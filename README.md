What I learned - 

-relearned that <!-- --> will negate my html because it's made for leaving a note in the html and that /* */ will negate my CSS because it's made for leaving a note in the CSS.

-that you can use <ul> child <li> to make a list and use that list for the nav bar

-height: 100vh will make the element take up 100% of the page's view height
